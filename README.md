4-Way Traffic Light Controller with Emergency State

Description:
This project is a 4-way traffic light controller with an emergency state implemented using an Arduino board. It manages the timing of traffic signals for each direction (North, South, East, and West), incorporates a yellow signal phase, and can detect nearby objects to trigger an emergency state.

Features:
Control of 4-way traffic signals: Red, Yellow, and Green lights.
Yellow signal phase to indicate transition.
Emergency state triggered by objects detected using an ultrasonic sensor.
Customizable timing for each signal phase.
Timer-based control for precise timing.


Requirements:
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) and appropriate resistors
Jumper wires
Arduino IDE (or compatible IDE) for uploading the code


Installation:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
Open the Arduino sketch file (.ino) from the downloaded repository.
Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.
